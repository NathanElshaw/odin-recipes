            <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <p>Prep Steaks and Shrimp: pat dry with paper towels and season with salt and black pepper. </p>
                <p>Heat the pan: place a heavy skillet or cast iron pan over medium/high heat and once its starting to smoke, swirl in 1/2 Tbsp oil. </p>
                <p>Sear steaks:  sear steaks for 4 minutes on the first side, 3 minutes on the second side and then sear the edges for 30-60 seconds per edge. Remove from heat 10 degrees before your desired temp on a thermometer. Transfer to a plate and tent with foil. The temperature will rise as it rests. </p>
                <p>Flavored Butter: reduce skillet to medium heat and melt in 3 Tbsp butter with quartered garlic cloves and a rosemary sprig.</p>
                <p>Sautee shrimp:  Add shrimp and sautee in a single layer for `1 minute, flip and cook another minute until opaque and pink then remove from heat</p>
                <p>Return steaks to the pan along with any accumulated juices. Turn the steaks to coat and spoon more flavored butter over them. Serve and enjoy. </p>
