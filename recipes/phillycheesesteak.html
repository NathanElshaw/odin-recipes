            <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <p>Slice hoagie rolls 3/4 of the way through with a serrated knife. Dice onions and thinly slice beef</p>
                <p>In a small bowl, stir together 2 Tbsp softened butter with 1 pressed garlic clove. Spread garlic butter onto the cut sides of 4 hoagie roll. Toast the buns on a large skillet, flat cooktop or griddle on medium heat until golden brown then set aside</p>
                <p>Add 1 Tbsp oil to your pan/cooktop and sautee diced onions until caramelized then transfer to a bowl.</p>
                <p>Increase to high heat and add 1 Tbsp oil. Spread the super thinly sliced steak in an even layer. Let brown for a couple of minutes undisturbed then flip and season with 1/2 tsp salt and 1/2 tsp black pepper. Sautee until steak is fully cooked through then stir in the caramelized onions.</p>
                <p>Divide into 4 even portions and top each with 2 slices of cheese and turn off the heat so the cheese will melt without overcooking the meat.</p>
                <p>Spread a thin layer of mayo on the toasted side of each roll. Working with one portion at a time, place a toasted bun over each portion and use a spatula to scrape the cheesy beef into your bun as you flip it over. Serve warm.</p>
